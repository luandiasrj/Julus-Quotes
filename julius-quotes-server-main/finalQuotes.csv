0,Julius,I know you're not gonna threw that away. Eat that. That's 30 cents worth of oatmeal.
1,Julius,That's 49 cents of spilled milk dripping all over my table. Somebody's gonna drink this milk.
2,Julius,That's $2 on fire.
3,Julius,That's $1.09 in the trash.
4,Julius,I'm not giving you money for walking around doing nothing. An allowance? I'll allow you to sleep here at night. I'll allow you to eat them potatoes. I'll allow you to use my lights. I'll allow you to drink my Kool-Aid. I'll allow you to nibble on them green beans. I'll allow you to look at that TV. I'll allow you to run up my gas bill. I'll allow you to walk up my stairs. I'll allow you to ask me these ridiculous-ass questions. Why should I give you an allowance when I already paid for everything you do? Who you know that gets an allowance? Huh? I'm finished.
5,Julius,"Sounds like Greg's doing better than me. Ask him for an allowance. You want to buy a leather coat, you need to get a leather-coat job."
6,Julius,"It's the same as a Snickers bar. But it's a lot cheaper. I go to this place, they got everything. Nickers, Two Musketeers, M&N's."
7,Julius,It's the same as a Milky Way. But it tastes like gravy.
8,Julius,"Why would I go out to relax, when I can relax at home for free?"
9,Julius,$20 to get in the club? We can dance at home for free.
10,Julius,"You live your whole life here for free. Tonya, you get gifts every day. Food is a gift. The heat is a gift. Your shoes are a gift. This house is a gift. Those frames on the walls are a gift. The magazines are a gift. That ashtray is a gift. This lampshade is a gift. [Rochelle sits down] That chair is a gift. This pillow is a gift. The remote control is a gift. The TV is a gift. [Rochelle turns the TV on] This carpet is a gift. The pink carpet in your room is a gift. That."
11,Julius,"Sodium hydroxide and hot sauce. It dissolves the clog and leaves the pipes with a fresh, spicy scent."
12,Julius,You ever heard of a Puerto Rican with a plugged-up sink?
13,Julius,"Unplug that clock, boy. You can't tell time when you sleep. That's 2 cents an hour."
14,Julius,You know how much a sponge costs?
15,Julius,"[accidentally tears a stamp] That's one cent worth of stamp. Chris, give me the tape."
16,Julius,"Hey, everybody. I got a surprise. A Betamax."
17,Julius,"Well, Santa's going to tell you. It costs $137."
18,Julius,"[to a blind boy] Eyesight? Hmm, that sounds expensive."
19,Julius,Do you know how much a puppy costs?
20,Julius,Does that come with a easy-to-pay gas bill?
21,Julius,Do you know they cost as much as a real car?
22,Julius,"And you ain't going to be satisfied with just one Hot Wheel. No, you going to want the whole collection of 'em."
23,Julius,"Now, how you going to pay for this eyesight?"
24,Julius,Do you really want your parents to work themselves to the bone just to get you a train set you're going to quit playing with after a week?
25,Julius,"What if this puppy grows up, gets rabies, bites somebody?"
26,Julius,Can you afford a lawsuit?
27,Julius,"Now, do you really want your daddy to take out a loan, just so you can get some Hot Wheels?"
28,Julius,You going to bankrupt your whole family just so you can get a puppy?
29,Julius,"If you're good, Santa will send you a train token, and you can take the subway downtown and get a job for Christmas."
30,Julius,"Look, we got great seats, free tickets, I got the day off, and I get to hang with my boys."
31,Julius,"If you threw in a nap, I'd die and go to heaven."
32,Julius," I told you, I don't need a plumber. Not when I got this."
33,Julius,"Yeah, Custodian in a Conga. I mean, it's like Janitor in a Drum, only it's 30% stronger, and 20% less."
34,Julius,That's three cents worth of gas.
35,Julius,"Oh, it'll work. It's been passed down for generations. My mother got it from my grandmother who got it from her great grandmother who got it from a Puerto Rican lady."
36,Julius,"No. It's just being at this new job, I'm with dead people everywhere I go. It just makes me feel like I need to appreciate life a little more. Oh, this is good! What is this, baby?"
37,Julius,"Man, that's $2."," feed the needy or be the needy?"""
38,Julius," We get one combo meal. Drew gets the burger, Tonya gets the fries, Chris, you can have the drink."
39,Julius,That was 89 cents worth of chicken. What? You didn't get enough to eat at school?
40,Julius,"Here. [hands Chris a note] Now, don't go pulling this money out. Somebody'll try to rob you. Don't tell your mother about this."
41,Julius,Do I look like a vegetarian to you? I work 60 hours a week. I lift papers and boxes all night. I don't want vegetables. I need meat.
42,Julius,Can I have my three cents change?
43,Julius,Hah! Bah-yah! That's $200-worth of food stamps.
44,Julius,I found a dollar!," or I am. And you don't want me to go shopping."""
46,Julius,"Can you do it yourself? [off Rochelle's look] Sure, baby, you go ahead. You look good. $200, man! Thank you, Lord."
47,Julius,Needs some salt.
48,Julius,Not bad. Needs salt.
49,Julius,"Yeah, but that's 18 cents worth of butter she's holding on her forehead."
50,Julius,Enjoy yourself. This is half off on a soda and box of Jujubes.
51,Julius,"Oh, what the hell. Here's a coupon for a free box of popcorn."
